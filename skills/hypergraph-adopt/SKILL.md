description: Bring a project with a past under the Hypergraph protocol - import an existing hosted graph as legacy history (mode A) or author honest prehistory from the repo itself (mode B), draw the adoption epoch, distill a real state graph, and install the AGENTS.md onboarding. Use hypergraph-init only for day-zero projects.

# Hypergraph Adopt

Conversion path for a repo **without** `.hypergraph/config.yml` that already has a
history: an existing hosted graph, a mature codebase, or both. Protocol:
[spec.md](references/spec.md) — especially *Adoption epochs*. Day-zero projects use
hypergraph-init instead; everything init does, this skill does *plus* the past.

## The CLI

`hypergraph …` — in a dev checkout of the protocol repo, `uv run tools/hypergraph.py …`.

## Modes

- **Mode A — a legacy graph exists** on a hosted store: import it verbatim as the
  fork; the original graph is never modified and remains the archive.
- **Mode B — no graph**: author 3–10 "Prehistory" record nodes distilled from the repo
  itself and the author's memory. Honest summary, never event-by-event reconstruction.

The adopted project's graphs are node files committed in its repo, exactly as for a
day-zero project. Nothing to decide.

## Workflow

1. **Inventory.** Start with the computed facts:
   ```
   hypergraph adopt --survey          # add --json to consume it structurally
   ```
   One call for the git shape (first commit, contributors, timeline signals,
   highest-churn paths), top-level source dirs, doc inventory, test framework, and
   **whether `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to `AGENTS.md`** — which step 6 must not break.

   **Timeline signals** are evidence about where an epoch might fall, not a decision:
   release tags in git, directory births (usually the signal that fires), and quiet
   gaps (the strongest signal on a paused-and-revived repo). Take them to the
   interview in step 3; the author says which meant something.

   Then detect the mode. Mode A: resolve **all** graph anchors — the root(s) *plus any
   index nodes the repo's docs declare as anchors* (docs saying "node X is the system
   of record" make X an anchor even if it isn't the root), confirming every node slug
   the docs cite is reachable from them. Then pull them in one call:
   ```
   hypergraph mirror pull --record-node-id <id> [--record-node-id <id>…] \
       [--state-node-id <id>] --out-dir .hypergraph/cache
   ```
   It writes `legacy-record.json` / `legacy-state.json` ready for step 4, prints a
   draft `archive:` block on stderr (keep it — step 4 pastes it), and errors if a
   node is reachable from both graphs' anchors. Confirm the node count covers what
   the docs cite before proceeding. If `mirror pull` cannot reach the graph,
   authenticate first (`hypergraph mirror doctor` says what is wrong) — never fall
   back to a repo-docs-only adoption of a graph-bearing project, which silently
   discards its memory.
2. **Read the repo properly.** The docs the survey listed (README, CHANGELOG,
   ARCHITECTURE/DESIGN, any `docs/` tree) and the highest-churn paths it named. In
   mode A, skim the pulled graph too. You are reading for the questions you cannot
   answer — what a directory birth was *for*, why a decision went the way it did,
   which doc claim the code now contradicts. Those are step 3's material.
3. **Interview the author.** See [The interview](#the-interview) below — one sitting,
   two parts: history (feeds the prehistory nodes in step 4) and current state (feeds
   the distillation in step 5). Run it once, here, after the reading and before any
   node is written. This is the part nothing can compute and it is the highest-value
   cargo in the whole adoption.
4. **Bring in the history, then init.** The two modes order these differently, and
   the rule underneath is: **`--init` before anything is *authored*** (nothing can be
   authored until a root exists to parent on), and **after** an import (so it adopts
   the imported legacy root instead of minting a rival — it says which it did:
   `adopted existing` / `minted`).

   **Mode A — import first, then init:**
   ```
   hypergraph import --record .hypergraph/cache/legacy-record.json \
       [--state .hypergraph/cache/legacy-state.json] --fork \
       --graph-dir .hypergraph/graph      # import needs no config — that is what
                                          # makes this order possible
   hypergraph adopt --init                # expect: "record root: <slug> (adopted existing)"
   ```
   `--fork` is **mandatory**: node_ids, slugs and topology are preserved verbatim,
   and the archive's ids are filed under `origin:` as provenance, so the repo becomes
   the continuing graph and owns its whole history (the host has no native fork —
   slugs are minted on create and immutable). Then paste the pulled `archive:` block
   into the config, each root with a `title` — **artifacts do not survive import**
   (node files have no artifact op), so the archive reference is the only pointer to
   them. Keep the legacy exports: step 5 reads them (`--resolve-prefixes --against`),
   and they are the only record of what stayed on the archive.

   **What travels, precisely.** Node ids, slugs, topology, titles, bodies, summaries
   and **tag names** come across; import writes the names onto each node's `tags:`
   and the vocabulary into `.hypergraph/tags.yml`, both of which you commit
   (`--no-tags` opts out). **Artifacts do not travel**, and neither does **pointer-tag
   history** — a `one_only` "current best" tag that moved leaves its chain in
   `.hypergraph/cache/import-report.json` and a loud stderr block; the epoch marker
   (step 5) is where that chain lands. If import renamed a tag it says so on stderr
   and keeps the original as `archive_name:`; nothing is dropped silently.

   For graphs above ~1000 nodes, offer **epoch-split**: import only the recent epoch
   and leave older history on the archive (never truncate — the archive keeps
   everything). A repo that adopted **before** tags travelled is not re-imported —
   run `hypergraph upgrade --graph tags`, which is detect-only until `--apply`.

   **Mode B — init first, then author:**
   ```
   hypergraph adopt --init                # mints both roots + a valid config
   ```
   Let the CLI write the mechanical parts — hand-written YAML is a proven failure
   mode (a stub config once made `check` report 0 violations while it silently
   guessed the roots). Then author the prehistory record nodes (`hypergraph new
   record`; they may parent on the record root) from the repo evidence *and* the
   interview. **Roughly one node per era or workstream** — about 3 for a young
   project, up to about 10 for a long-lived one. Each carries `## State Impact`
   lines feeding step 5. Do not let 10 become a changelog: each node is an honest
   summary of a real era. Cite what each claim came from — a doc, a commit range,
   or the interview.
5. **Epoch marker, then distillation.**

   **Marker.** One decision record node titled "Adopted Hypergraph" documenting the
   conversion (what was imported/authored, from where, what stayed on the archive).
   Parentage (SPEC: Adoption epochs): full-import mode A → parent = the **newest
   legacy node**; mode B → parent = the **newest prehistory node** — with several
   workstreams, parent the marker on **every** prehistory tip, so one high-water
   mark covers the whole authored history; epoch-split only → the marker becomes the
   record **root** of the local graph (`--root`) and records the archive lineage in
   its content.
   ```
   hypergraph adopt --marker <slug>       # records the epoch, refusing a slug that
                                          # does not resolve
   ```
   That `epoch:` block is what makes `check` exempt strictly-older nodes from I2.
   Then gitignore `.hypergraph/cache/`. **Do not put state-graph statistics in the
   marker** — it is written before the state graph exists, and record nodes are
   immutable; describe what you imported or authored. **Do put pointer-tag history
   in it**, if step 4 reported any: each chain as prose — which nodes held the
   pointer, in order, and when it moved — saying plainly that the reasons were never
   recorded upstream. The protocol deliberately does not model the chain; writing it
   here is what makes that a routing decision instead of data loss.

   **Distillation → state graph.** The skeleton must reflect what is *actually
   known*, not an empty template. **Re-read the interview answers first** — working
   from memory of them is how a `broken` status quietly becomes `working`:
   - Architecture components from the repo + graph (3–8 nodes, init granularity).
   - **Per-branch mining**: walk the legacy graph / repo docs for current-status
     claims, key decisions, and dead ends. If the graph exceeds one context window,
     fan out subagent readers per branch and merge their briefs.
   - **Id-prefix→slug resolution**: docs citing raw node-id prefixes (e.g.
     `b3ea0b95`) must be mapped to slugs before you write provenance — never cite a
     prefix. `hypergraph adopt --resolve-prefixes --against <export.json>` maps them
     across every tracked doc and **reports ambiguity rather than guessing**.
   - Dead ends land as **negative knowledge** with real evidence slugs (legacy slugs
     resolve in the imported record graph; in mode B cite the prehistory/marker).
   - Statuses honest: a claim the docs contradict is `broken`, unverified is `open`.
   - Route the interview's Part 2 answers: 1–2 become negative knowledge and `broken`
     statuses; 4 becomes `blocked`; 5 belongs in a decision record node.
   - Every claim cites resolvable slugs; a claim is a bullet **or a prose
     paragraph** — both are checked. **One slug per bracket**: `[rec: a] [rec: b]`,
     never `[rec: a, b]`, which the checker does not read as a citation at all.
   - **Advance the HWM to the record *tips*, not to the marker.** On a wide DAG the
     marker's ancestors are one branch, so marking it leaves everything else
     unreconciled — one adoption set it and found 111 nodes still outstanding.
     `hypergraph hwm --tips` prints the frontier to write. In the adoption you *are*
     the reconcile pass, so the write is `hypergraph update <state-root>
     --reconcile`, by hand, in the root's `## Reconciliation` block.
6. **Onboarding install.**
   - Append [agents-block.md](references/agents-block.md) to the repo's `AGENTS.md`
     (create the file if absent) — idempotently: if `<!-- hypergraph:begin -->` is
     already present, replace the existing block instead of appending a second one.
   - **Contract reconciliation**: when the existing AGENTS.md prescribes a
     conflicting discipline (e.g. "commit findings as <other system> nodes"), amend
     those sections to route through hypergraph — never leave two contradictory
     contracts standing. This is **two writes, not one**, and doing only the first
     is the common failure:
     1. The authoritative amendment goes **inside the sentinels**, woven into the
        numbered item it qualifies, alongside whatever else is project-specific (the
        epoch marker slug, the prehistory count).
     2. A short pointer goes **at the head of each conflicting section**, where a
        reader actually meets it. Never rewrite the author's prose — a dated
        one-line note above it is enough.

     `hypergraph upgrade` will not overwrite a block once you have edited it — it
     reports the block and steps back, naming the shipped template to merge against.
   - **Never break a CLAUDE.md→AGENTS.md symlink**: step 1's survey already reported
     whether either file is a link and where it points. Edit the *target*, never the
     link.
   - Write `.hypergraph/AGENTS.md`: the full onboarding — the four non-negotiables
     expanded, this project's graph roots and epoch, where the archive lives (mode
     A), the skills to use, and the check command verbatim. Say how to get the CLI
     too — it is a package, not a file: `uv tool install hypergraph-protocol`.
   - **Install the skills, and make sure they can be committed.**
     ```
     hypergraph skills install            # into ./.claude/skills
     git check-ignore -v .claude/skills   # silence is what you want
     ```
     If a broad ignore rule (`.*`, `.claude/`) hides them, every instruction you
     installed is dead on arrival for the next clone. Un-ignore in the same commit
     that un-ignores `.hypergraph/`.
7. **The gate.** Before you commit: `hypergraph sync` — it exports, regenerates
   `STATE.md`, checks, and publishes if a mirror is configured, and it must
   **exit 0**. The archive was read-only for the whole of this; verify afterwards if
   you want the proof — its root's `revision` and `updated_at` must be unchanged.

## The interview

Step 3, and prose on purpose: nothing here is a CLI verb, because CLI-generated
questions become CLI-generated answers become claims nobody derived. **One sitting,
two parts.** Ask the generic questions below *seeded with what the survey actually
reported* — name the directory births, the churn leaders, the contributors, the
release tags in git. "What was `dashboard/` for, when it landed in February?" gets an answer;
"describe your project's eras" gets a shrug.

**Part 1 — History** (feeds the prehistory nodes, step 4):

1. Does the project split into eras? Here are the timeline signals — which of these
   boundaries are real, and what would you call each era?
2. What did the project set out to do, and how did that change?
3. What was the biggest architectural decision, and what were the alternatives you
   rejected?
4. What was built and later abandoned or ripped out?
5. What did you try that failed?
6. What kept forcing `<highest-churn file>` open, over and over?
7. What triggered each of these directory births — `<dir>` in `<month>`, …?
8. Who owned what? (the survey names the contributors)
9. What would you do differently if you started again?
10. What context exists only in your head, or in a PR thread nobody will read again?

**Part 2 — Current state** (feeds the distillation, step 5):

1. What did you try that didn't work, and would waste a fresh agent's day?
2. What in the docs is now false?
3. What is the most fragile part — what breaks when touched?
4. What is blocked on something outside this repo?
5. What are you deliberately *not* doing, and why?

Three rules:

- **A brain-dump substitutes for the questions.** If the author would rather write
  than be asked — a pasted message, a notes file, an old design doc — mine that
  first and then ask only what it left open. Someone who already has the context
  written down somewhere is the common case.
- **A declined interview is recorded, not hidden.** If the author skips it, say so in
  as many words: claims derived from repo evidence alone, no author input. In mode B
  that goes in the prehistory bodies; **in mode A there are no prehistory bodies, so
  it goes in the epoch marker and in `.hypergraph/AGENTS.md`.** Say what the gap
  costs, not just that it exists — intent is the part evidence cannot supply, so
  phrase those claims as claims about the evidence, or mark them `open`. Hand the
  author the questions it could not settle. An adoption that reads as author-informed
  when it was not breaks I8.
- **Answers are evidence, not prose to paste.** You still write the claims and you
  still cite. An interview answer is cited to the prehistory node that records it.

## Authoring nodes: four traps

Every one of these cost a real adoption a throwaway node or a hand-edit. None is
discoverable from the templates.

- **`## State Impact` comes from flags, never from the body.** A body containing that
  heading is refused (`--body already contains a '## State Impact' heading`). Use
  `--impact` once per line, or `--none "<reason>"`. The same is true of `## Current`
  on a state node.
- **`--impact` already writes `- target: `.** Pass `"<slug> — <delta>"`, *not*
  `"target: <slug> — <delta>"` — copying a line out of the template verbatim yields
  `- target: target: …` and an I2 violation.
- **You cannot choose a state node's slug.** They are minted `adjective-noun-####`;
  `--slug sim-substrate` is refused. So the readable `NEW <kebab-name>` target in an
  impact line never resolves to the node you then mint. Write the mapping down —
  kebab name → minted slug — in the node that declared them.
- **Record nodes are immutable.** `hypergraph update <record-slug>` refuses. A
  correction is a **new child node**, which is why you should not write a count you
  have not measured yet.

## Guardrails

- The legacy graph is read-only throughout — the fork is the import; the archive is
  frozen. Never write, tag, or re-parent archive nodes.
- Record nodes at/after the marker follow full I2 discipline immediately — the epoch
  exempts only strictly-older history, and authoring is never exempted.
- Distilled claims must be derivable from cited nodes/docs (SPEC I8); when the
  source is ambiguous, say so in the claim rather than rounding up to certainty.
- Don't inflate the state graph: 3–8 components with honest statuses beat 20 nodes
  of aspiration. Negative knowledge is the highest-value cargo — mine for it.
- **The CLI computes facts; you write claims.** `--survey`, `--resolve-prefixes`,
  `--pull` and `--init` deliberately generate no prose: no prehistory bodies, no
  `## Current` text, no negative-knowledge entries. A claim nobody derived from
  evidence they read is not re-derivable, which breaks I8 by definition — and it is
  exactly the aspirational template-filling these guardrails exist to prevent.
